# v9-hyprdots

A minimal, reproducible Arch Linux + Hyprland base.

## What this is
- Clean Hyprland configuration
- Sensible defaults
- FetchX included by default
- Designed to be understood and extended

## What this is not
- A rice
- A full desktop environment
- A hardware auto-installer

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/v9mirza/v9-hyprdots
cd v9-hyprdots  
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
```
Log out and start Hyprland.


Philosophy
Clarity over cleverness.
Minimal over complete.
Infrastructure, not aesthetics.
